<!-- SHORT:
Data science, machine learning, and data manipulation and preparation are all core components of a future, trendy, world of software engineering. Many of these are built with "quick hacks," tiny scripts, or based on pipelines that are cobbled together from multiple components, frameworks, and the like. Mars Geldard and Paris Buttfield-Addison explore if software architecture matters to this world.

LONG:
Data science, machine learning, and data manipulation and preparation…all of these are core components of a future wave of software engineering. However, many of these components of the future wave are built upon “quick hacks,” “quick scripts,” or pipelines cobbled together from multiple frameworks and miscellaneous (often open source) components.

Mars Geldard and Paris Buttfield-Addison examine if software architecture matters in a world of big data and machine learning where software is a patchwork of pieces glued together by scripts and frameworks, or if it can matter due to the nature of the beast. Using a combination of original research, anecdotes, testimonials, and case studies from the real world, Mars and Paris explore whether data scientists, machine learning engineers, and other members of the latest generation of computing professionals, working with data and creating a patchwork, care about software architecture, or, indeed, can care about software architecture.

You’ll find out if architecture matters when you’re building a “little script,” or whether your “quick hack” needs any form of architectural knowledge, thought, or design. Everything is a pipeline made up of components, other people’s code, and tiny bits of glue code. Mars and Paris walk you through if this is just another way to accrue technical debt or if architecture truly doesn’t matter in this world. -->

# Does software architecture matter...

👋 Hello!

^ Hi everyone!

---

^ We're Mars, and Paris. You can tweet us, we love that.

^ We're from Tasmania, Australia.

# Data science, machine learning, numerical computing, etc.

^ We're here to talk about data science, machine learning, numerical computing, all that sort of stuff.

This talk came about after we spoke at SA Con in New York City, in February this year.

We had a bunch of great conversations.

We'd honestly expected SA Con to be really dry. 

But it wasn't. 

It was great.

It was exciting.

We'd imagined Software Architects to be boring, unenthused, and all manner of other less than flattering things.

But we found a community of passionate people thinking and doing things to improve the technology industry as a whole.

And we had some conversations. We're often doing machine learning, or data science work.

And we noticed that a lot of the things the really interesting software architects we met were doing, or discuss, sounded a bit out of the ordinary in the data science world.

So we did a little bit of research.

This included a few things.

Surveys

Conversations ("semi-structured interviews")

Textual analysis of data-science writings

Textual analysis of software architecture writings

It's very preliminary, but it's been showing some interesting directions.

So, our talk today is some of our preliminary findings on this.

There's a few tentpole questions that we're going to structure this around.

# Questions

* What does software architecture mean when you're not a 'software engineer' or 'software architect'?
* What does 'software architecture' mean to you?
* What does 'software engineering' mean to you?
* What does 'tech debt' mean to you?
* Do you write lots of 'little scripts' or do you 'architect a solution'? Or do you do something else?
* Do you work with 'software architects' (either by title, or by what you think that means in terms of what they do?)
* Are you a 'software architect'?

---

We both have a lot of experience in qualitative research. So this talk takes that approach, mostly. And we'll touch on the implications of what we've found.

# Agenda

* answer the questions
* discuss what it all means
* next steps
