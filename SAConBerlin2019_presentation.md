<!-- SHORT:
Data science, machine learning, and data manipulation and preparation are all core components of a future, trendy, world of software engineering. Many of these are built with "quick hacks," tiny scripts, or based on pipelines that are cobbled together from multiple components, frameworks, and the like. Mars Geldard and Paris Buttfield-Addison explore if software architecture matters to this world.

LONG:
Data science, machine learning, and data manipulation and preparation…all of these are core components of a future wave of software engineering. However, many of these components of the future wave are built upon “quick hacks,” “quick scripts,” or pipelines cobbled together from multiple frameworks and miscellaneous (often open source) components.

Mars Geldard and Paris Buttfield-Addison examine if software architecture matters in a world of big data and machine learning where software is a patchwork of pieces glued together by scripts and frameworks, or if it can matter due to the nature of the beast. Using a combination of original research, anecdotes, testimonials, and case studies from the real world, Mars and Paris explore whether data scientists, machine learning engineers, and other members of the latest generation of computing professionals, working with data and creating a patchwork, care about software architecture, or, indeed, can care about software architecture.

You’ll find out if architecture matters when you’re building a “little script,” or whether your “quick hack” needs any form of architectural knowledge, thought, or design. Everything is a pipeline made up of components, other people’s code, and tiny bits of glue code. Mars and Paris walk you through if this is just another way to accrue technical debt or if architecture truly doesn’t matter in this world. -->

# Does software architecture matter...
# ...in a world of 'quick hacks'?

## Mars Geldard & Paris Buttfield-Addison

^ Welcome!

# [fit] 👋 Hello!

^ Hi everyone!

---

![inline](speakers.png)

^ We're Mars, and Paris. You can tweet us, we love that.

---

^ We're from Tasmania, Australia.

---

# Data science, machine learning, numerical computing...

^ We're here to talk about data science, machine learning, numerical computing, all that sort of stuff.

---


# Data science, machine learning, numerical computing...
## Quick hacks!?

^ Plus quick hacks, and how that all fits...

---

# We spoke at SACon NYC...

^ This talk came about after we spoke at SA Con in New York City, in February this year.

---

# And we had a lot of great conversations.

^ And we had a lot of great conversations.

---

# Not dry and uninspiring.

^ We'd honestly expected SA Con to be really dry.  But it wasn't. 

---


# It was great.

^ It was great.

---

# It was exciting.

^ It was really exciting. We'd imagined Software Architects to be boring, unenthused, and all manner of other less than flattering things.

---

# Passionate people trying to improve things.

^ But we found a community of passionate people thinking and doing things to improve the technology industry as a whole.

---

# Conversations ensued.

^ And we had some conversations. We're often doing machine learning, or data science work. And we noticed that a lot of the things the really interesting software architects we met were doing, or discuss, sounded a bit out of the ordinary in the data science world.

---

# So we did a little bit of research.

^ So we did a little bit of research.

^ PARIS: We both have a research background. I have a PhD in Computer Science, and I specialise in Qualitative Research into how and why people are behaving around, and with, technology.

> Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century
-- https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century

^ Data Science, starting about 8-10 years ago, starting to become the hottest thing in technology. 

---

TODO


^ And we started to wonder: Does Data Science, and the associated domains of machine learning, and so on, care about things that Software Architects care about?

---

# Methodology | Qualitative

^ Our methodology was a fairly conventional qualitative approach.

---

# Methodology | Qualitative

- Surveys with free-form responses
- Semi-structured Interviews
- Textual analysis

^ Largely ventered around surveys, but also a couple of informal interviews with people. We also included a textual analysis of a many software architecture and data science writings, for interest's sake.

---

# Methodology | Qualitative | Analysis

- Coding
- Grounded-theory inspired approaches

^ Analysis was performed using coding, and a variety of thematic analysis and grounded-theory inspired approaches.

---

# Coding?

^ When talking to people who aren't regularly practising Qualitative Research, we've recently had to make a few asides to explain Coding.

---

TODO EXPLAIN CODING ETC.

---

# So what did we find?

^ It's very preliminary, but it's been showing some interesting directions.

---

# Today's talk
## Some preliminary findings.

^ So, our talk today is some of our preliminary findings on this.

---

# Tentpole questions

^ There's a few tentpole questions that we're going to structure this around.

---

# Tentpole questions

* What does 'software architecture' mean to you?
* What does 'software engineering' mean to you?
* What does 'tech debt' mean to you?
* Do you write 'little scripts' or do you 'architect a solution'? Do you do something else?
* Do you work with 'software architects'?
* Are you a 'software architect'?

^ We both have a lot of experience in qualitative research. So this talk takes that approach, mostly. And we'll touch on the implications of what we've found.

---

# Agenda

* showcase the answers to the tentpole questions
    * discuss what it all means
* next steps

^ So, here's what we're going to do in this session.

---

# Questions at the end, please

^ We'll leave time for your questions at the end.

---

# Preliminary, exploratory

^ This session, and the research we did is going to keep going.

---

# Participation



---

![inline](graph_participants.png)

^ When we performed our preliminary analysis to give this talk, we'd have 470 respondents. This is an excellent response rate.  "Data Science", "Software Engineering", "Software Architecture", "Other".

# Do you write lots of 'little scripts' or do you 'architect a solution'? Or do you do something else?

---

# Findings, summarised

---

# Architecture doesn't matter, but not because they don't care.

---

# Finding a solution is more important than finding a good solution.

# To a point.

# Most data scientists are not software engineers.

---

# Most data scientists are passable programmers.

---

# Most data scientists are passable programmers.
# But they're still not software engineers.

---

# We need more data scientists who are also software people.

---

# But we also need more software people who embrace the nimble nature of building data science tools and pipelines.

What you have built is a great prototype of a predictive product, but you still have to push it through the engineering roadmap. What you need is a team of professional Software Engineers by your side to take your (disposable) proof of concept and turn it into a performant, reliable, loosely coupled and scalable system!

^ Having basic (or even advanced) programming skills is key to put your end to end experiment together, however it does not mean that you have created an application that is production ready. Unless you have come into Data Science and Machine Learning (ML) from an IT background and have tangible experience into building enterprise, distributed, solid systems, your Jupyter notebook does not qualify as a great piece of software and sadly does not make you a Software Engineer!
